            While data-driven art, or artistic data visualizations, are a
            relatively new medium; the ways in which they interrogation the
            creation of meaning in data visualizations are extremely important
            and cannot be ignored. As such, in this blog post I aim to explore
            an artwork from a meaningful data-driven art campaign by Yoshiyuki
            Mikami, in conjunction with the World Wildlife Fund, called the
            <cite>Population by Pixel</cite> (Mikami, 2008). To do this, I start
            by providing a denotative analysis of an image from the campaign,
            evaluating the images form, and meaning. Thereafter, I use this
            analysis to look at how it goes beyond the traditional data
            visualization to become a piece of data-driven art.

            As Jenny Kidd notes in their 2015 book
            <cite>Representation</cite>, all media consists of two levels: the
            denotative level, which is what is seen; and the connotative level,
            which is what is understood and represented (Kidd, 2016: 23). As
            such, in order to understand the campaign’s purpose, we must first
            start by breaking it down on a denotative level. Looking at figure 1
            below, which is an image from the Population by Pixel campaign, we
            see a pixelated image of a giant panda – with the text “1600 is not
            enough” written on the bottom left. With that, we can then note that
            the text in the bottom left is referring to two things: the current
            population of giant pandas; and the number of pixels in the image.
            From this, we can then see that each pixel correlates to the current
            giant panda population – where the purpose of the artwork, and
            campaign in general, is to shed light on the shrinking number of
            giant pandas. As such, we can then conclude that through this use of
            data, and clear artistic intent, the image must be presenting a form
            of data-driven art – as defined by Fernanda Viégas and Martin
            Wattenberg who, in their 2007 article
            <cite>Artistic Data Visualization: Beyond Visual Analytics</cite>,
            list these two elements as key factors for data-driven art (Viégas
            and Wattenberg, 2007: 2).

            Although, while some may argue that this information could easily
            have been spread using traditional data visualization methods, such
            as a line graph showing the species population decrease overtime; I
            believe that the choice of a data-driven artwork was deliberate, and
            extremely clever. Though most modern images are extremely high
            resolution, containing no discernable pixels; by subverting this
            expectation, and displaying very clear pixilation, the data-driven
            artwork is more likely to gain the audience’s attention, making them
            acutely aware of the decreasing giant panda population. Not only
            that, but because of the link between the number of pixels and the
            giant panda population, the vanishing of animals because of
            pixilation directly correlates with the extinction of the animal in
            real life. In contrast, a traditional data visualization would not
            be able to spread this message as easily, nor as meaningfully –
            requiring its focus to be on the data, as opposed to a specific
            point-of-view.
          </p>

          <p>
            In conclusion, we can then see that the choice of creating a
            data-driven artwork was deliberate and extremely clever, as it
            allowed for the meaning of the image to be more impactful than other
            mediums – such as traditional data visualizations.
